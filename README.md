# Zomato-Analysis
In the Zomato Analytics project, we utilized SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to analyze key restaurant metrics. The dataset covered restaurant names, locations, cuisines, pricing, customer ratings, and service availability. We cleaned and modeled data using Power Query Editor and DAX in Power BI, and built interactive dashboards to visualize insights. Key analyses included identifying factors influencing customer ratings, tracking restaurant openings by year, and examining the availability of table booking and online delivery services. This data-driven approach revealed significant trends that informed strategies to improve restaurant performance and customer satisfaction.Zomato has 9,551 restaurants, with 86% based in India. Currently, only 12% offer table booking, and 25% provide online delivery, highlighting areas for growth. Improving customer reviews can increase the percentage of restaurants rated 4 or higher.
